# Project 4 (Part 3): Kernels
In which we deal with some convoluted kernels.

If you haven't already, download the data from:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rj2LMGRe7d8TauegFwobQdzeMdn-XokP/view?usp=sharing

Then, unzip the data file in the topmost directory of this repo (i.e.
the directory where this README.md is found).

This is the same data as for Project 4 (Part 2), so instead you can just
copy it from your Part 2 directory.

**Caution: Do not add the data to your repo.**

Key files:
- colonels3.ipynb: The homework assignment. Read this first.
- cnn.py: A starter file for the code you have to write.
- training.py: A solution for Project 4 (Part 2). You can try using your own, however.
- datamanager.py: A solution for Project 4 (Part 1). You can try using your own, however.
- monitor.py: Code for monitoring minibatch training.
- test.py: Unit tests for the functions you will be asked to write.
- zebrashop.py: A GUI for detecting zebras.
