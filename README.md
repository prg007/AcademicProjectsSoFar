# AcademicProjectsSoFar
The folders inside this repository consists of academic projects that I have built during my time in college

## Zebra Classifier

This is a deep learning project.

## Random Maze

I created this project for my Data Structures and Algorithms Class. This program uses the Union Find algorithm to randomly create a 10 by 10 maze. It takes upto a minute to demonstrate how it uses the Union Find Algorithm and sets up a random colorful maze. Download the folder and run CreateMaze.py

## Graphical Game

In this project, I used the "tkinter" module of Python to create a graphical game. The objective of this game is to jump across objects and reach a door at the upper-left corner of the window. If you fall over by a distance of more than 100 metres you will have to restart the game. Download the folder and run test.py

## Twitter Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed data taken from Twitter. The goal was to produce a map that shows how popular tweets about a given topic are in each state. In order to create maps like the one below, which shows how frequently people in each state are posting tweets containing the word “beach”, with darker blues representing more tweets (per capita), download the trends.py file located inside ProjectTwitter folder and at the very last line type your desired query item inside the draw_map_for_query(make_searcher(‘#Your desired search query’)) function.

 ## Ecosystem simulation
 
 In this project, I simulated a small ecosystem. In this ecosystem birds of various species look for food. Sometimes they find it and eat it. Other times they find it, but so does another bird. The birds then have the choice to fight for the food or to be passive. Depending on their decisions, they could get the food or not, but they could also be injured in the fight. I created different species of birds with varying behaviors and see how those species thrive (or not) in certain situations. The Hawks and Doves class is later uncommented and replaced with an Evolving class that represents birds of various kinds.

 ## Dice Game
 
 In this project I made a program that plays a dice game called Greed. The game of Greed is a dice game between two players. The dice in question differ from regular dice in that they give numbers between 0 and 5, instead of between 1 and 6. The game begins with both players having a score of zero and proceeds in turns. The player whose turn it is can choose any number of dice to roll. They then roll those dice (all at once) and add the total of the dice to their score. If they go over 100, the other player is declared the winner. (A score of exactly 100 is acceptable.) Play then passes to the other player, who does the same. Play alternates in this manner until either one player goes over 100 and loses or a player chooses to pass. When a player passes (that is, rolls zero dice on their turn) the other player gets one more turn to roll, and then the game is over. If at that point neither player has gone over 100, the player with the higher score wins. (Ties are possible.) There are tools that let computer players play the game against each other, as well as tools that help figure out how good different computer players are. One can also write their own strategy function, which they can use to compete against each other. Have fun!
Download all the 3 .py files and then execute the pr1.py file on terminal
